# GetStarted

Welcome to the GetStarted repo! Here you will find useful files and document templates to assist with your research at the Spacecraft Robotics and Control Laboratory. 

# Figures for Publications

All supporting material for publications must be **professional** (ideal colour theme: red and black) with a **readable font size** (about the same size or slightly smaller than the main body font size). Use font style Times New Roman.

- To generate plots and animations of experiment or simulation data, check out [PlottingFunctions](https://github.com/Carleton-SRCL/GetStarted/tree/main/PlottingFunctions) which has plotting functions of the SPOT platforms and the robotic manipulator, as well as three example files that demonstrate their usage with sample data from the [SPOT software](https://github.com/Carleton-SRCL/SPOT).
- To generate high-quality diagrams, flow charts, _etc_., we recommend using https://www.mathcha.io/.
