# Intro

These plotting functions `DrawSpacecraft.m` and `DrawARM.m` have been provided to help students with generating professional looking figures for publications.

# Examples

Three example files have been provided that use the plotting functions to plot experiment data. Example files have additionally been provided that use the plotting functions to animate experiment data.
- Example #1: Plots an experiment using the chaser, targer, and obstacle
- Example #2: Plots an experiment using the chaser, manipulator, and target
- Example #3: Plots multiple experiment trials against simulation data

These plots will be published in upcoming papers:
- Savytska, C., and Ulrich, S., “Experimentally Validating Model Predictive Control for Spacecraft Proximity Operations with Moving Obstacles,” _AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics Meeting,_ Lihue, HI, January 19-23, 2025, submitted.
- Crain, A., Hovell, K., Savytska, C., and Ulrich, S., “Optimal Robotic Capture of an Uncooperative Spinning Spacecraft via Deep Learning Vision and Guidance,” _AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics Meeting_, Lihue, HI, January 19-23, 2025, submitted.
